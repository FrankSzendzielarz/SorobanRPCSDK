## The Stellar_CrossPlatform Demo Project

The Stellar_CrossPlatform demo showcases how to implement Stellar functionality in a .NET MAUI application that runs on multiple platforms.

### Project Structure

The demo application follows a standard MAUI project structure with these key components:

- **Stellar_CrossPlatform (Core Project)**
  - **App.xaml/App.xaml.cs**: Application entry point
  - **AppShell.xaml/AppShell.xaml.cs**: Shell navigation container
  - **MainPage.xaml/MainPage.xaml.cs**: Main user interface
  - **StellarService.cs**: Core service for Stellar blockchain interactions
  - **Resources**: Styles, images, and other shared resources

- **Platform-Specific Projects**
  - **Android**: Android-specific implementations and configurations
  - **iOS**: iOS-specific implementations and configurations
  - **MacCatalyst**: macOS-specific implementations and configurations
  - **Windows**: Windows-specific implementations and configurations
  - **Tizen** (optional): Tizen-specific implementations (if you need Samsung devices support)

### StellarService Implementation

The core `StellarService` class provides the main functionality for interacting with the Stellar network:

```csharp
public class StellarService 
{
    private const string StellarKeyAlias = "STELLAR_SK";
    private ISecureStorage _secureStorage;
    private HttpClient _httpClient;
    private StellarRPCClient _sorobanClient;

    // Constructor initializes the service
    public StellarService()
    {
        _secureStorage = SecureStorage.Default;
        _httpClient = new HttpClient();
        _httpClient.Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3000);
        _httpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org");
        var httpClientFactory = new SimpleHttpClientFactory(_httpClient);
        _sorobanClient = new StellarRPCClient(httpClientFactory);
    }
    
    // Methods for account management and Stellar operations
    public async Task<MuxedAccount.KeyTypeEd25519> GetAccount()
    {
        try
        {
            // Implementation for retrieving or creating an account
        }
        catch
        {
            return null;
        }
    }
    
    public async Task<long> GetBalance(MuxedAccount.KeyTypeEd25519 account)
    {
        // Implementation for checking account balance
    }
    
    // Other Stellar operations
}
```

### Key Implementation Highlights

1. **Cross-Platform Secure Storage**

   The demo uses MAUI's `ISecureStorage` for securely storing sensitive data like Stellar private keys:

   ```csharp
   // Store a private key securely
   await _secureStorage.SetAsync(StellarKeyAlias, Convert.ToBase64String(account.SeedBytes));
   
   // Retrieve a private key securely
   string storedKey = await _secureStorage.GetAsync(StellarKeyAlias);
   ```

   This approach leverages platform-specific secure storage mechanisms:
   - Android: Android Keystore System
   - iOS: Keychain
   - macOS: Keychain
   - Windows: Windows Data Protection API

2. **HttpClient Factory Implementation**

   The demo provides a simple `HttpClientFactory` implementation compatible with the StellarRPCClient:

   ```csharp
   public class SimpleHttpClientFactory : IHttpClientFactory
   {
       private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;
       public SimpleHttpClientFactory(HttpClient httpClient)
       {
           _httpClient = httpClient;
       }
       public HttpClient CreateClient(string name)
       {
           return _httpClient;
       }
   }
   ```

3. **UI Integration**

   The MainPage demonstrates how to connect the Stellar operations to the UI:

   ```csharp
   private async Task UpdateAccountInfo()
   {
       try
       {
           var account = await _stellarService.GetAccount();
           var balance = await _stellarService.GetBalance(account);

           AccountLabel.Text = $"Account: {account.AccountId}";
           BalanceLabel.Text = $"Balance: {balance.ToString()}";
       }
       catch (Exception ex)
       {
           await DisplayAlert("Error", $"Failed to load account: {ex.Message}", "OK");
       }
   }
   ```

## Secure Key Management

Proper key management is critical for blockchain applications. The demo project shows several approaches:

### 1. Platform Secure Storage

As shown above, MAUI's `SecureStorage` provides a cross-platform API for secure data storage using each platform's native secure storage mechanisms.

### 2. Key Generation and Recovery

The demo implements both random key generation and persistent storage:

```csharp
// Generate a new random account if none exists
account = MuxedAccount.Random();
await _secureStorage.SetAsync(StellarKeyAlias, Convert.ToBase64String(account.SeedBytes));

// Recover an existing account from secure storage
byte[] seed = Convert.FromBase64String(storedKey);
account = MuxedAccount.FromSecretSeed(seed);
```

### 3. Best Practices for Key Management

When implementing key management in production applications:

- **Never hardcode keys** in your application code
- **Consider biometric authentication** before accessing stored keys
- **Implement key recovery mechanisms** such as backup phrases
- **Use encrypted backups** when storing keys externally
- **Consider multi-factor authentication** for high-value operations
- **Implement proper key rotation** policies
- **Offer custodial options** for less technical users

## Installation

To add the Stellar RPC SDK to your MAUI project:

1. Add the NuGet package reference to your project file:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="StellarRPCSDK" Version="1.0.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```

2. Configure dependency injection in `MauiProgram.cs`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient("StellarClient", client =>
{
    client.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org");
});

builder.Services.AddSingleton<StellarRPCClient>();
builder.Services.AddSingleton<StellarService>();
```

3. Initialize the network in your application's startup:

```csharp
// Use the testnet for development
Network.UseTestNetwork();

// Or use the public network for production
// Network.UsePublicNetwork();
```

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Android

- Request the `INTERNET` permission in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
  ```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
  ```
- Consider using the Android Keystore for additional security

### iOS and macOS

- Update your `Info.plist` to allow outgoing connections:
  ```xml
  <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
  <dict>
      <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
      <true/>
  </dict>
  ```
- Use keychain access groups for shared keystores across your apps

### Windows

- Consider implementing a Windows Hello integration for additional security
- Ensure your app has the appropriate capabilities in the package manifest

## Best Practices for MAUI Integration

### 1. Performance Considerations

- Implement caching for frequently accessed blockchain data
- Use background processing for blockchain operations

- Implement proper cancellation token support for long-running operations

### 2. Responsive UI

- Always provide clear visual feedback during blockchain operations
- Implement timeout handling and retry mechanisms
- Use MVVM pattern to separate blockchain logic from UI
- Consider implementing skeleton loading screens for blockchain data

### 3. Error Handling

- Implement comprehensive error handling for network issues
- Provide user-friendly error messages for blockchain-specific errors
- Consider implementing offline mode with queued transactions
- Log detailed errors for debugging without exposing sensitive information

### 4. Testing

- Test on all target platforms
- Implement unit tests for blockchain logic
- Use the Stellar testnet for integration testing
- Consider implementing UI automation tests for critical blockchain workflows

## Advanced Integration Scenarios

loyalty points, customers, tokenised tangible assets, supply chain tracking identifiers and so on
as Stellar assets on public, immutable ledger.

### Multi-Signature Accounts

For enhanced security in high-value applications. Realize an escrow or co-owned account using Stellar accounts
that require multiple owners to authorise an operation.


### Soroban Smart Contract Integration

For implementing complex business logic.
