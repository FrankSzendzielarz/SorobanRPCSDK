This console app optionally tests XDR serialisation for all XDR types, as well as end-to-end tests the various use cases, such
as getting account balances, making payments. 

This combines the test suite described in the project roadmap for Tranche 1 Deliverables 1,2 with the sample usage program described in 
Tranche 2 deliverable 5 (https://communityfund.stellar.org/dashboard/submissions/recl8E9u3mHSyWh5z).

Further, in the XDR serialisation use case, random XDR is generated for all XDR objects, which can be used by the Community for other 
testing other SDKs.
