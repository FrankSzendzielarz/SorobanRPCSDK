# Cross Platform Soroban RPC SDK

A lightweight SDK enabling native consumption of the Stellar Soroban RPC gateway across multiple platforms.

## Motivations
We are developing a larger, privately funded project that leverages Stellar as its exclusive transaction processing platform. The architecture integrates Soroban RPC server as the primary entrypoint to the Stellar network, interfacing with native front-ends across multiple platforms:
- Android and iOS 
- Tizen OS for Smart TVs
- Unity native game development (post-MVP)
- WASM web applications (post-MVP)
- Samsung smart wearables (optional)

During development, we encountered significant platform compatibility challenges with existing SDKs:

1. **Tizen Smart TV Integration**: While Tizen embraces .NET development, current Stellar SDKs rely on NaCl native libraries that fail on production TV sets despite working in emulators. Additionally, certain SDK dependencies are not permitted in the runtime environment.

2. **Cross-Platform Mobile Development**: Both Android and iOS development face similar compatibility issues when attempting to integrate existing SDKs.

3. **Unity Game Development**: The current SDK lacks Unity Editor property metadata and encounters conflicts with editor dependencies (e.g., Newtonsoft Json serialization), preventing effective design-time integration.

4. **Soroban-Specific Functionality**: Existing SDKs and documentation don't fully address newer Soroban features, such as:
   - Post-simulation transaction assembly
   - Streamlined client-side signing of Soroban authorization invocations

After investing significant time researching these obstacles, we've developed a collection of software components that address these challenges. We propose packaging these into a lightweight, maintainable SDK as a contribution to the Stellar community. Furthermore, we envision automating the maintenance process to ensure long-term sustainability without requiring constant manual intervention.

## Goals

### Minimum Deliverable
Our initial scope focuses on developing a .NET Core SDK for Soroban RPC servers, targeting .NET Standard 2.0, supporting:

#### Platform Coverage
- Tizen OS (Smart TV and Samsung wearable integration)
- Cross-platform native development:
  - Android
  - iOS
  - Windows
  - Mac Catalyst
  - Tizen (via MAUI, future implementation)

#### Automated Maintenance
The SDK will feature automated ingestion and processing of:
- Soroban RPC JSON specifications
- Stellar XDR specifications
- Integration with existing codebase

#### Core Functionality
- Cryptographic operations:
  - Hashing implementations
  - Ed25119 signing (NaCl-independent)
- Utility functions:
  - Soroban Authorization signing
  - Simulation-based transaction generation

### Unity-Specific Deliverable
Unity integration requires additional customization:
- Unity Editor metadata implementation
- Resolution of dependency conflicts (e.g., Newtonsoft)
- IL-weaving for internal library management

These modifications will enable seamless integration with the Unity Editor while maintaining full functionality.

### Extended Deliverables
Our .NET implementation opens possibilities for broader platform support through:

#### Native Binary Support
- AOT compilation for multiple platforms/architectures
- Single-file executable generation with embedded runtime components
- Link-time trimming for optimized deployment

#### Integration Options
1. **In-Process Channel**:
   - Protobuf-based metadata generation
   - Static linking capabilities
   - Automated client class generation
   - XDR/JSON RPC marshalling
   - Built-in constraint validation

2. **Embedded Server Implementation**:
   - Standalone executable with Kestrel server
   - Proxy/shim functionality
   - gRPC endpoint exposure
   - HTTP WebAPI with SwaggerUI/OpenAPI documentation
   - Flexible deployment options

### Maintenance Strategy
- Automated monitoring of upstream changes (Soroban RPC/XDR specs)
- GitHub Actions for automated updates and compilation
- Minimal manual intervention requirements

### Current Implementation Status
Core components exist within our private repository as part of our larger project implementation. The proposed funding would support:
1. Consolidation of existing components into a community-focused SDK
2. Research and implementation of extended deliverables
3. Development of automated maintenance systems

This funding effectively supports broader ecosystem development while indirectly supporting our larger Stellar-based initiative.
